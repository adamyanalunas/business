# Thoughts on Being A Good Manager

These are just some high level thoughts I’ve had about mid-level management from the view as pseudo-manager team lead in a small company and as an employee in huge companies.

This is not a recipe. It is a guide. Apply as much as makes sense to you and your professional environment.

### Empathy

You can’t look at someone and know every detail of their life. They may be quietly suffering through something.

Your team is made of people, not machines that produce code. They will perform inconsistently. They will have good and bad days. They might direct their anger at you, even if you’re not the cause.

Remind yourself that everyone has their own struggles. Do your best to make the struggles of your team as few as possible. Remind your team that you’re there to support them and give them the opportunity to come to you with any concerns they have.

### Patience

Managers are expected to assign work and see it get done. A manager is rated on the amount of work done by their team. It can be challenging to have to sit and wait for someone else to do the work. Be patient.

If the work isn’t getting done or you aren’t hearing updates, ask why. Don’t ask how soon something will get done. Ask if there are blocks, if there is confusion, if there’s something personal preventing the team member from getting the work done.

### Diversity

Everybody learns differently. Everybody works differently.

Some folks can only absorb knowledge while playing with a toy. Others need a chaotic, noisy environment to focus.

Understand that each team member has unique needs and you can only support them if you know about those needs. Pay attention to your team’s interactions and let them know every manner of work and learning is valid.

### Guidance

Team members should want to grow their professional skills and a manager should help them achieve those goals.

Ask team members what they like doing, what they hate doing, what they want to change. Listen to those answers and work with them, over time, to find ways to meet those needs. Be honest if the business can’t support those needs.

### Conflict Resolution

Nobody agrees with everyone all the time. Manager should be a trusted source to initiate conflict resolution, even on a personal level. 

Project a calm and level attitude, even if inside your brain you’re screaming. Managers should push panic up the management chain, now down to team.

### Shield From Business

When the team doesn’t need to know about all of the business chaos going on, manager will deflect and let team focus on work.

Some team members work better when they understand the whole picture and are involved in every step. Others get overwhelmed if they are expected to deal with more than the code in front of them. Only tell people what they need to know.

### Availability

Is open to all team members for public or private discussions.

Manager’s do not need to be immediately available but should always work to find time in their calendar to talk.

### Responsibility

Do what is promised, when promised, or communicate when that will be done.

Teams are expected to do what is asked of them and managers are no different. If a team member asks you for something—even something as small as forwarding an email—make sure it gets done. An unreliable manager is an untrustworthy manager and trust is hard to earn, once lost.
